# Outliner

Outliner is an [Octave](octave.sourceforge.io/) program used to outline pictures and measure an object's area in pixels.


## Installation

### Linux

If on Linux, install and unpack files from the Terminal.

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Windows

On Windows move the files manually to your desired directory.


## Usage

### Octave command line

You can enter the Octave command line by typing "octave" once installed (install.sh automatically installs it).

[//]: # (Used python because of the color similarities, because matlab isn't supported on all markdowns)

```python
cd("pathtofolder");
source.m
```

### Octave GUI

Open the file in the program and when asked about working directory press change.
